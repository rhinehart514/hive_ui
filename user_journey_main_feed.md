- Feed visibly shifts after significant affiliations

## 7. State Transitions & Card Lifecycle

### 7.1 Content States
- Cold: Initial state, limited visibility
- Warming: Gaining traction through reactions/reposts
- Hot (Pulse): High engagement, increased visibility
- Cooling: Engagement slowing, visibility decreasing

### 7.2 Card Decay Rules
- Event Cards: Visible until event start time
- Repost Cards: 48-hour default visibility
- Quote Cards: 24-hour default visibility

- All animations respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Purposeful motion, not decorative

### 9.2 Haptic Feedback
- Light impact for standard interactions
- Medium impact for confirmations (RSVP, Join)
- Consistent across all interactive elements
