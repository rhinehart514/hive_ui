- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation for the AppEventBus system
- ✅ Completed integration testing of all event types
- ✅ Ensured proper lifecycle management in all components using AppEventBus

### 2. Cache Management ✅ (100%)

- ✅ Implemented basic cache manager with invalidation tracking
- ✅ Connected cache manager to AppEventBus for reactive invalidation
- ✅ Finalized cache invalidation strategy for all data types
- ✅ Implemented TTL policies appropriate for different data types
- ✅ Added analytics logging to monitor cache hit/miss rates
- ✅ Integrated enhanced caching with repository example (CachedProfileRepository)
- ✅ Implemented cache warming for critical data

### 3. Offline Support ✅ (100%)

- ✅ Implemented offline action queue for critical operations
- ✅ Created connectivity monitoring service
- ✅ Implemented optimistic UI updates for offline operations
- ✅ Created conflict resolution strategies for offline-online data sync
- ✅ Built robust error recovery for interrupted operations
- ✅ Added UI indicators for offline status and pending actions

### 4. Backend Services Integration ✅ (100%)

- ✅ Basic Firestore data structure implementation
- ✅ Initial authentication setup
- ✅ Optimized data schema for frequent query patterns
- ✅ Implemented custom security rules for granular access control
- ✅ Set up efficient data indexing for common queries

### 5. Cloud Functions Development ✅ (100%)

- ✅ Set up Cloud Functions project structure
- ✅ Created user engagement tracking functions
- ✅ Implemented recommendation engine foundation
- ✅ Built analytics tracking and reporting functions
- ✅ Created notification management systems
- ✅ Developed trending content algorithms
- ✅ Built moderation tools
- ✅ Implemented social graph analysis

### 6. Authentication & Security ✅ (100%)

- ✅ Basic email authentication implementation
- ✅ Finalized multi-provider authentication (social logins)
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive permission model
- ✅ Set up data encryption for sensitive user information

## Recently Completed Items

### 1. Conflict Resolution Strategies

Enhanced the conflict resolver with:
- Advanced field-level conflict resolution
- Smart merging of nested objects and arrays
- Automatic detection of ID fields for object lists
- Strategy customization per field

### 2. Error Recovery System

Implemented a robust error recovery system with:
- Error categorization (network, auth, resource, etc.)
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Multiple recovery strategies based on error types
- Detailed error tracking and management

### 3. UI Indicators for Offline Status

Created comprehensive UI components:
- `OfflineStatusBanner` for app-wide status display
- `OfflineStatusIndicator` for inline status indication
- `OfflineAwareButton` for action context
- `OfflineAwareFormField` for form-specific indicators

## Integration with Features

The core infrastructure now provides a solid foundation for feature development. All components have well-defined interfaces and integration points for:

1. **Profile Management**: Offline profile editing with conflict resolution
2. **Events System**: RSVP functionality with offline support
3. **Spaces & Communities**: Space membership changes with offline queuing
4. **Content & Feed**: Post creation and interaction with offline capabilities

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been created for all core infrastructure components:
- `offline_support_documentation.md`: Details on offline support architecture
- API documentation for all major classes and interfaces
- Integration guides for repository implementations
- Best practices for error handling and recovery

## Next Steps

With core infrastructure at 100% completion, focus can now shift to feature completion, which is currently at approximately 30%. The next priorities should be:

1. Complete implementation of the profile management features
2. Enhance the events system with editing and recurring event functionality
3. Implement the spaces and communities management features
4. Develop the content creation and feed personalization features

Each of these features can now leverage the robust core infrastructure for state management, offline support, and error handling.
