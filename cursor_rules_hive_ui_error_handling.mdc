# HIVE UI Error Handling and Data Safety

## 1. Null Safety Practices

### 1.1 Null Checking
- Always use null-aware operators (`?.`, `??`, `!.`) appropriately according to context.
- Implement explicit null checks before accessing potentially null values, especially from external data sources.
- Provide sensible default values for nullable parameters with the `??` operator.
- Use `late` variables only when you're certain they will be initialized before use.

### 1.2 Nullable Parameter Design
- Only make parameters nullable when they are genuinely optional.
- Document nullable parameters clearly with dartdoc comments.
- When a parameter is nullable, provide guidance on how the method behaves with null values.
- Use the null safety migration tool to identify non-null usage patterns.

## 2. Exception Handling

### 2.1 Try-Catch Blocks
- Surround all I/O operations, network calls, and external API interactions with try-catch blocks.
- Catch specific exceptions rather than using general `Exception` or `Error` catches.
- Provide fallback behaviors for recoverable errors.
- Log all caught exceptions with sufficient context for debugging.

### 2.2 Error Propagation
- Use typed exceptions with meaningful names for different error scenarios.
- Include relevant error context in exception messages.
- Consider using result objects (Either<Error, Success> pattern) for critical operations.
- Implement error boundaries at logical component boundaries.

## 3. Firestore and Firebase Safety

### 3.1 Data Validation
- Never trust raw data from Firestore without validation.
- Implement model classes with explicit type checking for all Firestore documents.
- Use `try-catch` with JSON parsing and document conversions.
- Set default values for missing fields to ensure consistency.

### 3.2 Query Safety
- Guard against non-existent documents with null checks.
- Handle empty query results gracefully with empty state UI.
- Implement timeout handling for Firebase operations.
- Use transactions for operations that need atomicity.

## 4. User Input Validation

### 4.1 Form Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs before submission.
- Provide clear, immediate feedback for validation errors.
- Implement both client-side and server-side validation.
- Use regex patterns for structured inputs like emails, phone numbers, etc.

### 4.2 Type Safety for Inputs
- Convert string inputs to appropriate types immediately after validation.
- Use safe parsing methods like `int.tryParse()` rather than forceful conversions.
- Handle conversion failures gracefully with user feedback.
- Consider implementing custom input formatters for specialized inputs.

## 5. Error UI Patterns

### 5.1 Error Presentation
- Always provide user-friendly error messages, never show raw exception details to users.
- Implement consistent error UI components across the app.
- For network errors, include retry options where appropriate.
- Use different visual treatments for different error severities.

### 5.2 Loading States
- Show appropriate loading states during async operations.
- Implement skeleton screens for better user experience during loading.
- Provide progress indicators for long-running operations.
- Consider implementing optimistic UI updates for common operations.

## 6. Debugging and Reporting

### 6.1 Logging
- Implement structured logging with severity levels.
- Include contextual information in log messages.
- Use dedicated logging for critical user flows.
- Consider implementing remote logging for production errors.

### 6.2 Crash Reporting
- Integrate Firebase Crashlytics or similar service for production crash reporting.
- Add custom keys to crash reports for better context.
- Review crash reports regularly and address common issues.
- Implement non-fatal error reporting for degraded experiences.

## 7. API Error Handling

### 7.1 HTTP Error Handling
- Handle different HTTP status codes appropriately.
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient errors.
- Parse error responses for detailed error information.
- Consider implementing circuit breakers for failing services.

### 7.2 Network Connectivity
- Handle offline scenarios gracefully with appropriate UI feedback.
- Implement local caching for critical data.
- Provide offline functionality where feasible.
- Queue operations for later execution when connectivity is restored.

## 8. Error Recovery

### 8.1 App State Recovery
- Persist critical app state to recover from crashes.
- Implement auto-save for user input in forms.
- Provide ways to restore unsaved work after app restarts.
- Ensure navigation state can be restored after interruptions.

### 8.2 Graceful Degradation
- Design features to work with limited functionality when full functionality is unavailable.
- Prioritize core functionality during error recovery.
- Implement feature flags to disable problematic features in production.
- Have fallback content for when primary content sources fail.
