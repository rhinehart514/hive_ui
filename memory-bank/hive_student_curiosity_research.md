## **üß† CORE STUDENT PSYCHOLOGICAL DRIVERS**

### **What Students Are Actually Curious About**

**Social Geography Questions:**
- "Who else is dealing with what I'm dealing with?"
- "What are people like me actually doing with their time?"
- "How do other students make this place work for them?"
- "Who figured out something I haven't figured out yet?"

**Campus Navigation Mysteries:**
- "What's actually happening that I don't know about?"
- "Where do the interesting people spend their time?"
- "What opportunities exist that aren't advertised?"
- "How do I find my people in this chaos?"

**Competence and Growth Hunger:**
- "Am I doing college right compared to others?"
- "What skills are other students building that I should know about?"
- "How do successful upperclassmen actually spend their time?"
- "What am I missing that everyone else seems to know?"

**Authentic Connection Seeking:**
- "Who shares my actual interests, not just my major?"
- "What communities exist beyond the obvious ones?"
- "How do I find people to do specific things with?"
- "Who else is questioning the same things I'm questioning?"

## **üì± WHAT STUDENTS ACTUALLY CHECK THEIR PHONES FOR**

### **The Real Feed Behaviors**

**Information Seeking (Not Entertainment):**
- "Did anyone figure out what's due tomorrow?"
- "Is there food/events/opportunities I should know about?"
- "What's the vibe/mood/energy level on campus today?"
- "Did anything important happen while I was in class?"

**Social Pulse Checking:**
- "What are my loose connections up to?"
- "Is anyone doing something I want to join right now?"
- "What's the social temperature - should I go out or stay in?"
- "Who's available and what are they actually doing?"

**Coordination Discovery:**
- "What groups/events/activities exist that I didn't know about?"
- "How do I join something that's already happening?"
- "What coordination problems do other people have solutions for?"
- "Who's organizing things I want to participate in?"

**Validation and Reality Checking:**
- "Am I the only one struggling with X?"
- "Are other people feeling the same way about Y?"
- "Is my experience normal or am I missing something?"
- "What are people actually honest about vs what they perform?"

## **üîç STUDENT RESEARCH QUESTIONS FOR FEED DESIGN**

### **Critical Questions About Campus Social Reality**

**Discovery Patterns:**
- What do students actually scroll looking for vs what they say they want?
- How do students currently discover campus opportunities they end up caring about?
- What social information changes their daily decisions?
- When do students choose to engage vs lurk vs ignore?

**Authenticity Drivers:**
- What content makes students feel "seen" vs "marketed to"?
- How do students distinguish between performative and genuine posts?
- What sharing behaviors build real connection vs just visibility?
- How do students want to represent themselves authentically?

**Community Formation Triggers:**
- What content makes students think "I want to know this person"?
- How do students recognize their people in campus environments?
- What shared experiences create lasting connections vs temporary interactions?
- How do students prefer to signal availability for new connections?

**Coordination Preferences:**
- How do students currently organize activities they actually want to do?
- What coordination friction makes students give up on plans?
- How do students balance structure vs spontaneity in social coordination?

- Ability to scale helpful behaviors

### **The Authentic Connection Seeker**
**What They're Curious About:**
- "Who else feels like an outsider sometimes?"
- "Where are the real conversations happening?"
- "How do I find my actual people?"

**Feed Behavior:**
- Looks for vulnerable/honest posts to connect with
- Shares struggles and authentic experiences
- Comments thoughtfully rather than just liking
- Avoids performative social spaces

**What Would Make Them Active:**
- Spaces designed for authentic sharing
- Protection from judgment and performativity
- Connection with people based on values/struggles, not just interests
- Tools for deeper conversation rather than surface interaction

### **The Lurker Optimizer**
**What They're Curious About:**
- "How do I get value without social overhead?"
- "What information helps me without requiring participation?"
- "How do I stay connected without being performative?"

**Feed Behavior:**
- Consumes much more than they create
- Appreciates useful information and authentic content
- Rarely posts but often acts on information they find
- Values efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio

**What Would Make Them Active:**
- Low-pressure ways to contribute value
- Information that directly improves their life
- Coordination tools that work without social performance
- Recognition that lurking/observing is valid participation

## **üí° FEED INNOVATION HYPOTHESES**

### **Hypothesis 1: Students Want "Social Infrastructure" Not "Social Media"**

**Research Question:** Do students prefer feeds that surface coordination opportunities over feeds that surface social performance?

**Test Design:**
- Compare engagement with "Sarah created a study group" vs "Sarah is studying"
- Measure which content types lead to real-world coordination
- Track whether utility-focused content creates stronger connections than entertainment-focused content

### **Hypothesis 2: Campus Curiosity Drives Engagement More Than Personal Validation**

**Research Question:** Are students more motivated by discovering campus opportunities than by social validation?

**Test Design:**
- Compare engagement with discovery-focused vs validation-focused content
- Track whether curiosity-satisfying content leads to platform retention
- Measure campus integration improvement for different content consumption patterns

### **Hypothesis 3: Authentic Representation Requires Coordination Context**

**Research Question:** Do students share more authentically when content is tied to coordination rather than performance?

**Test Design:**
- Compare authenticity of posts tied to activities vs posts for social validation
- Track whether coordination-focused sharing builds stronger connections
- Measure student comfort with vulnerability in different content contexts

### **Hypothesis 4: Students Want to Discover Their People, Not Be Discovered**

**Research Question:** Are students more interested in finding communities than in building personal audiences?

**Test Design:**
- Compare discovery features vs broadcasting features usage
- Track whether community-finding or personal-branding content drives retention
- Measure which features lead to lasting connections vs superficial follows

## **üìä RESEARCH METHODOLOGY FOR STUDENT DESIRE VALIDATION**

### **Ethnographic Research Approaches**

**Campus Observation Studies:**
- Shadow students during "phone checking" moments
- Map actual information-seeking behaviors vs stated preferences
- Identify coordination pain points in real campus contexts
- Document how students currently discover opportunities they end up caring about

**Digital Behavior Analysis:**
- Study what students screenshot/save from social media
- Analyze which content types lead to real-world action
- Track information-seeking patterns across platforms
- Map social media usage to campus engagement correlation

**Student Interview Deep Dives:**
- "Show me the last 5 things you checked your phone for"
- "Walk me through how you found out about [activity you ended up loving]"
- "What campus information do you wish you had but don't know how to find?"
- "When do you feel like your social media reflects your actual life vs performs for others?"

### **Prototype Testing Approaches**

**Feed Concept Testing:**
- Create mockups of different feed paradigms (coordination vs social vs information)
- Test student comprehension and interest in different content types
- Measure which concepts make students want to contribute vs just consume
- Validate whether utility-focused feeds satisfy social curiosity

**Curiosity-Driven Feature Testing:**
- Test features designed around student research questions
- Measure which discovery mechanisms actually get used
- Validate whether campus-specific content drives engagement
- Test social features that prioritize connection over performance

**Authentic Sharing Environment Testing:**
- Create low-pressure sharing contexts tied to coordination
- Test whether students share differently when content serves utility
- Measure authenticity and vulnerability comfort in different contexts
- Validate whether coordination-focused sharing builds connections

## **üéØ CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR FEED DIRECTION**

### **Fundamental Feed Philosophy Questions**

**Purpose Questions:**
- Do students need another place to post, or better ways to coordinate what they're already doing?
- Should the feed optimize for social discovery or coordination efficiency?
- Can a feed serve authentic connection without enabling performative behavior?
- Is student curiosity about campus life different enough from general social curiosity to warrant specialized design?

**Design Questions:**
- What content types satisfy student curiosity without creating social pressure?
- How do we surface coordination opportunities without creating FOMO?
- Can we design sharing that builds community rather than personal brand?
- What makes students feel "seen" vs "surveilled" in campus contexts?

**Community Questions:**
- Do students want to discover new people or coordinate better with known people?
- How do we serve both social exploration and community depth?
- Can authentic campus representation happen in a feed format?
- What community behaviors do we want to encourage vs just enable?

---

**Research Priority:** Before building any feed system, we must understand what students are actually curious about and how those curiosities translate into coordination and community formation behaviors on campus.
