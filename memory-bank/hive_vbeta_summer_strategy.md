# HIVE vBETA Summer Strategy 2025

_Last Updated: January 2025_  
_Context: June-August 2025 Campus Environment_

## 1. Summer Context & Strategic Purpose

### The Summer Campus Reality

**Population Dynamics (June-August 2025):**
- **Total students:** 200-400 per campus (vs. 10,000+ during academic year)
- **International students:** Often isolated, need quiet connection pathways
- **Incoming first-years:** Hungry for social clues and soft onboarding
- **Builder-minded users:** Early explorers seeking influence and expression
- **Research assistants:** Summer jobs, internships, academic projects
- **Local students:** Summer programs, staying for personal reasons

**Environmental Characteristics:**
- **Reduced social density:** Fewer organic interactions and community formation
- **Seasonal isolation:** Traditional social structures (clubs, events) dormant
- **Structural confusion:** Limited dining options, modified campus schedules
- **Opportunity for experimentation:** Lower stakes for platform testing and iteration

### Strategic Purpose: Summer as Shaping Ground

**Core Thesis:** Summer 2025 is not a waiting periodâ€”it's the proving ground for HIVE's most essential behaviors.

**Primary Objectives:**
1. **Prove utility before social density:** Show students HIVE offers value without requiring large communities
2. **Establish behavioral anchors:** Calendar Tool and Stack Tools become daily habits
3. **Recruit and activate Builders:** Identify student leaders without forcing participation
4. **Learn platform dynamics:** Understand which Tools work, how Spaces activate, what drives engagement
5. **Prepare for fall scale:** Build systems and patterns that can handle 10x user growth
