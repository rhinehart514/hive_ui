# HIVE vBETA Student Experience Design

_Last Updated: January 2025_  
_Focus: International Students, Incoming Students, All Campus Students_

## 1. Student Behavioral Context

### The Campus Reality

**Summer Campus Population (June-August 2025):**
- 200-400 students total on most campuses
- International students (often isolated, need quiet connection)
- Incoming first-years (hungry for social clues, soft onboarding)
- Builder-minded users (early explorers seeking influence)
- Research assistants and summer job holders
- Local students staying for summer programs

**Existing Pain Points:**
- **Social disorientation:** No informal intel about campus rhythms
- **Structural confusion:** Dining hours, library schedules, social opportunities unclear
- **Light presence gap:** Only binaries (GroupMe chat or nothing) - no ambient awareness
- **Tool fragmentation:** Discord for some groups, Instagram for events, email for official info
- **Seasonal isolation:** Reduced social density makes connection harder
