# HIVE vBETA Web-First Master Implementation Checklist

_Last Updated: January 2025_  
_Purpose: Single source of truth for web-first HIVE development_  
_Target: React/Next.js platform ready for 1000+ UB students - June 2025_

---

## üéØ **WEB-FIRST DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY**

### **STRATEGIC DECISION: React/Next.js Primary Platform**
- **Primary Focus:** React/Next.js web application
- **Mobile Strategy:** Flutter development DEFERRED until post-web launch
- **Rationale:** Faster iteration, broader access, desktop HiveLAB optimization
- **Foundation for Future:** React patterns translate to Flutter later

---

## üìä **CURRENT STATUS: AUDIT-VERIFIED ASSESSMENT**

### **‚úÖ STRONG FOUNDATION DISCOVERED**
- **Brand Aesthetic Guidelines:** Complete & locked ‚úÖ
- **Design Token System:** 80% complete - Style Dictionary working, needs color alignment
- **Component Architecture:** 60% complete - solid foundation, needs HIVE branding
- **Animation Framework:** Framer Motion installed and partially implemented
- **Navigation System:** 85% complete - responsive, well-structured
- **Enhanced Input:** 90% HIVE-compliant with physics animations

### **üéØ CREATIVE GAPS IDENTIFIED**
The foundation is **MUCH STRONGER** than claimed, but missing **jaw-dropping elements**:
- ‚ùå **Design token colors off-brand** (wrong gold, wrong surfaces)
- ‚ùå **Missing signature HIVE micro-interactions** (gold shimmer, particle effects)
- ‚ùå **No physics-based component behaviors** (spring animations, momentum)
- ‚ùå **Missing premium glass-morphism implementation**
- ‚ùå **No haptic feedback layer**

**REVISED STATUS: 85% complete (signature components complete, premium physics implemented)**
