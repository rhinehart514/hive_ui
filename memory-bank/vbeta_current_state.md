# HIVE vBETA Current State - January 2025

_Last Updated: January 2025_  
_Status: Post-Cleanup, vBETA-Focused_

## ‚úÖ What's Actually in Memory-Bank (vBETA Only)

### Core Product Definition
- **hive_vbeta_specification.md** - Four-system architecture (Profile, Spaces, HiveLAB, Feed TBD)
- **vbeta_reality_check.md** - Critical scope boundaries and constraints
- **hive_vbeta_summer_strategy.md** - 8-week evolution plan for summer 2025
- **hive_vbeta_student_experience.md** - Student journey mapping and value props
- **hive_vbeta_technical_architecture.md** - Technical implementation strategy

### System Specifications
- **profile_system.md** - Personal behavioral dashboard (Calendar Tool, Motion Log, Stack Tools)
- **spaces_system.md** - Pre-seeded containers with dormant/active states
- **hivelab_system.md** - Builder opt-in system for Tool creation
- **tools_system.md** - 5-Element composition system with linear logic

### Foundation Documents
- **hive.md** - Core product vision and philosophy
- **hive_architecture.md** - Clean architecture patterns
- **brand_aesthetic.md** - Dark infrastructure design system
- **ui_ux_guidelines.md** - Implementation standards
- **tech-stack.md** - Flutter/Firebase technical foundation

### Strategic Context (Kept for Reference)
- **hive_vbeta_context_foundation.md** - Campus context and student needs
- **hive_vbeta_assumptions_validation.md** - Key assumptions to validate

## üóëÔ∏è What Was Deleted (Non-vBETA)

### Removed Files
- `app_completion_plan.md` (1,234 lines) - Massive V1 implementation plan
- `module1_plan.md`, `module2_content.txt`, `module3_content.txt` - Module-based planning
- `hive_vbeta_competitive_analysis.md` - Strategic analysis, not product spec
- `hive_vbeta_ub_system_validation.md` - System validation analysis
- `analytics_events.md` - Post-vBETA optimization
- `api_contracts.md` - Advanced technical implementation
- `offline_error_handling.md` - Advanced technical features
- Empty files: `design_token_system.md`, `animation_system.md`, `hive_button_system.md`

## üéØ vBETA Core Focus (Confirmed)

### What We're Building
1. **Profile System** - Calendar Tool + Motion Log + Stack Tools as behavioral foundation
2. **Spaces System** - Pre-seeded dormant containers activated by Builder Tool placement
3. **HiveLAB System** - Simple Builder opt-in with 5-Element Tool composition
4. **Feed System** - TBD based on summer learning

### What We're NOT Building (vBETA Constraints)
- Student-created Spaces
- Complex Tool logic (branching, loops, variables)
- Builder tiers, applications, or approval workflows
- University system integration
- Advanced analytics dashboards
- Social networking features
- Advanced moderation systems

## üìã Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Define Feed System** - Determine if/how Feed fits into vBETA
2. **Lock MVP Scope** - Define the 30-second student experience
3. **Prototype Core Flow** - Profile ‚Üí Calendar Tool ‚Üí Space activation ‚Üí Builder pathway

### Critical Decisions Needed
- Which 3 Stack Tools ship in vBETA?
- What's the minimum viable Tool composer?
- How do we measure behavioral platform success?

**Purpose:** This document serves as the definitive state of vBETA documentation after cleanup, focusing only on what's actually being built for summer 2025.
