# HIVE vBETA Full-Stack Master Plan & Strategic Implementation Guide

_Last Updated: January 2025_  
_Purpose: Robust roadmap for HIVE vBETA - web-first platform with advanced features and strategic flexibility_  
_Approach: Full-stack development with product decisions made iteratively during implementation_

---

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL NOTE FOR AI DEVELOPERS

**MANDATORY COLLABORATIVE APPROACH:**
Before implementing ANY feature, component, or system:

1. **DISCUSS with the user** - Talk through the feature requirements, user experience, and business logic
2. **DETERMINE together** - Collaborate on the best UI patterns, data flows, and technical approach  
3. **VALIDATE decisions** - Confirm product choices align with HIVE's strategic goals and user needs
4. **BUILD iteratively** - Implement with user feedback and refinement at each step

**Never build features in isolation.** Every implementation decision should be a collaborative discussion that considers product strategy, user experience, technical constraints, and business logic. The user brings domain expertise and strategic context that's essential for proper implementation.

## ðŸŽ¯ STRATEGIC ARCHITECTURE & CORE DECISIONS

### **LOCKED FOUNDATION DECISIONS**
- **Platform Strategy:** WEB-FIRST React/Next.js (primary) â†’ Flutter mobile (post-launch)
- **Tech Stack:** React 19 + Next.js 15 + TanStack Query v5 + Zustand 5 + shadcn/ui + CVA + Framer Motion 11 **LOCKED**
- **Product Scope:** ADVANCED FEATURES PREPARED (complete vBETA, not minimal MVP)
- **Launch Strategy:** Weekly evolution post-launch building momentum for fall rollout
- **Technical Foundation:** Firebase backend with real-time coordination capability
- **Feed System:** DEFERRED TO LAST (build behavioral foundation first)

### **STRATEGIC FLEXIBILITY FRAMEWORK**
**Product decisions will be made iteratively during development:**
- Stack Tool selection for Profile system (which 3 tools ship in vBETA?)
- HiveLAB complexity level (how sophisticated should Element composition be?)
- Space activation triggers (what moves dormantâ†’active states?)
- Builder recognition thresholds and social proof levels
- Feed integration timing and complexity
- Mobile development prioritization and feature parity

4. **Event Social Layer:** How much "who's going" visibility vs privacy?
5. **Feed Integration Timing:** With vBETA launch or post-launch evolution?
6. **Mobile Development Trigger:** Success metrics that justify Flutter development?

### **Weekly Evolution Post-Launch**
**Continuous improvement framework for summer momentum building:**
- **User feedback integration** with rapid iteration cycles
- **Feature expansion** based on actual usage patterns
- **Community building** through Builder recognition and tool highlighting
- **Campus expansion** preparation based on UB success metrics
