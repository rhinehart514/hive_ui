# HIVE vBETA - Reality Check & Scope Boundaries

_Last Updated: January 2025_  
_Status: Critical Reference for Development_

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN vBETA

### Spaces System
- **Pre-seeded Spaces only** - Admin-created, no student Space creation
- **Auto-assignment** based on major, housing, year (no university integration needed)
- **Simple dormant/active states** - activated by first Tool placement
- **No capacity limits** - unlimited Builders per Space
- **No system-wide Spaces** - no global posting or campus-wide discussion

### Tools System  
- **5 Core Elements** - ChoiceSelect, ReminderPing, FeedTrigger, AnonSubmit, TimerBlock
- **Linear composition only** - no branching, loops, or complex logic
- **Basic forking** - simple parent-child attribution, no version syncing
- **All-Space or Builder-only visibility** - no opt-in subgroups or targeting
- **No analytics dashboards** for Builders - admin tracking only

### HiveLAB System
- **Simple opt-in** - any UB student becomes Builder instantly
- **No application process** - no leadership verification or approval workflow  
- **No Builder tiers** - everyone has same access and capabilities
- **Weekly prompts** - basic collection, no threading or community discussion
- **No mentorship system** - no formal guidance or collaboration tools

### Profile System Integration
- **Calendar Tool** as behavioral heartbeat
- **Motion Log** for personal tracking
- **Stack Tools** (Quiet Hours, Reminder, PromptPost)
- **Now Panel** for current status
- **Auto-joined Spaces** display

## ‚ùå NOT IN vBETA (Future Roadmap)

### Advanced Community Features
- ‚ùå Builder application and approval workflows
- ‚ùå Builder tier system (Probationary/Standard/Senior)
- ‚ùå Mentorship and collaboration systems
- ‚ùå Builder networking and direct messaging
- ‚ùå Community forums and discussion threading
- ‚ùå Cross-Space Builder coordination tools

### Advanced Analytics & Insights
- ‚ùå Builder performance dashboards
- ‚ùå Cross-Space Tool comparison analytics
- ‚ùå Community feedback aggregation interfaces
- ‚ùå Tool optimization suggestions and insights
- ‚ùå Advanced usage pattern analysis

### Complex Tool Features
- ‚ùå Tool version syncing and update propagation
- ‚ùå Semantic versioning trees and branching
- ‚ùå Opt-in member targeting and subgroups
- ‚ùå Advanced Element combinations beyond 5-Element limit
- ‚ùå Conditional logic and branching workflows

### Advanced Space Management
- ‚ùå Student-created Spaces or custom Space types
- ‚ùå Builder capacity limits per Space (4 max)
- ‚ùå Advanced Space governance and moderation tools
- ‚ùå Cross-Space coordination and partnership systems
- ‚ùå AI-powered Space discovery and recommendations

### Platform Integration
- ‚ùå University system integration (official partnerships)
- ‚ùå Advanced calendar and productivity tool sync
- ‚ùå External API integrations and third-party tools
- ‚ùå Campus facility and resource integration
- ‚ùå Alumni and community member connections

## üéØ vBETA CORE FOCUS

### What We're Actually Building
1. **Behavioral Infrastructure** - Calendar + Motion Log + Stack Tools as foundation
2. **Space Activation** - Dormant Spaces come alive through Builder Tool placement  
3. **Tool Composition** - Simple Element assembly with linear logic only
4. **Builder Opt-In** - Frictionless Builder access for any UB student
5. **Weekly Iteration** - Basic prompt collection for platform evolution

### Success Metrics for vBETA
- Space activation rate through Tool placement
- Tool creation and placement frequency
- Student engagement with Calendar and Motion Log
- Builder opt-in conversion and retention
- Basic Tool usage and interaction patterns

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL BOUNDARIES

### Technical Constraints
- **No university backend access** - public data and student self-reporting only
- **Linear Tool logic only** - no branching, variables, or complex conditions
- **5 Element maximum** per Tool composition
- **Basic attribution only** - no complex version management
- **Admin analytics only** - no Builder-facing dashboards

### Community Constraints  
- **No formal governance** - simple opt-in Builder system
- **No capacity management** - unlimited Builders per Space
- **No advanced moderation** - basic community guidelines only
- **No collaboration tools** - individual Builder Tool creation
- **No networking features** - focus on Tool creation, not social connection

### Platform Constraints
- **Pre-seeded Spaces only** - no student Space creation
- **Basic prompt collection** - no community discussion or threading
- **Simple Tool discovery** - no AI recommendations or advanced filtering
- **Manual Space assignment** - based on student-reported information
- **Basic error handling** - no advanced conflict resolution

## üìã DEVELOPMENT GUARDRAILS

### When Reviewing Features
1. **Is this actually in vBETA scope?** Check against this document
2. **Does this require university integration?** If yes, it's out of scope
3. **Does this add Builder tiers or approval?** Not in vBETA
4. **Does this create complex Tool logic?** Keep it linear and simple
5. **Does this require advanced analytics?** Admin-only in vBETA

### When Planning Implementation
1. **Start with simplest version** - no advanced features or edge cases
2. **Focus on core behavioral loop** - Calendar ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Spaces ‚Üí Motion Log
3. **Prioritize Builder Tool creation** - the heart of the platform
4. **Keep community features minimal** - focus on utility over social
5. **Plan for post-vBETA evolution** - but don't build it now

**Purpose:** This document serves as the definitive boundary check for vBETA development. When in doubt about feature scope, refer here first.

**Usage:** Review before any feature planning, development, or documentation to ensure alignment with actual vBETA capabilities rather than future roadmap aspirations.
