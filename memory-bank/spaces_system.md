# HIVE vBETA - Spaces System Documentation

_Last Updated: January 2025_  
_Status: Implementation Ready - Final Specification_

## 1. System Overview

**Strategic Role:** Spaces are behavioral containers with fixed six-surface architecture that exist in dormant state until activated by Builders. They provide structured contexts for Tool placement and community formation without forcing social engagement.

**Core Philosophy:** "Community is earned through Builder action, not assumed through membership."

## 2. Space Architecture - Six Fixed Surfaces

### ✅ What Is a Space?
A Space is a fixed container made up of six hard-coded UI surfaces. These six surfaces appear in the same order across every Space. By default, they do nothing — they only gain behavior when a Tool is placed inside one of them.

### 🧱 The Six Surfaces (Always Present)

| Surface | Function | Behavior Trigger |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| **Pinned** | Static intro block | Editable by Builder |
| **Posts** | Vertical content thread | Activated only via PromptPost or similar Tools |
| **Events** | Event calendar surface | Populated via EventCard Tool + RSS |
| **Tools Stack** | List of Tools added to this Space | Always visible, changes as Tools are placed |
| **Chat** | Real-time thread | Locked in vBETA (opens in v0.1.1) |
| **Members** | Grid of students in the Space | Auto-filled by join logic |

**Non-Negotiable:** These are not customizable. Students can't rearrange them, delete them, or create new ones.

### 🛠 Tools Define Behavior
Tools are added by Builders only.

Each Tool is designed to bind to one of the above surfaces. For example:
- A **PromptPost** activates the Posts surface
- An **EventCard** populates the Events surface  
- A **JoinForm** appears in the Tools Stack and governs access

Tools are made of modular settings called Elements. Builders combine these in HiveLAB, preview them, and place them into Spaces. Once placed, the Tool is live — other students can interact with it immediately.

## 3. Space Types & Auto-Assignment

### RESIDENTIAL SPACES

## 4. Space Lifecycle States

### 🚦 Visibility & Activation Rules
- All Spaces are visible (previewable) from day one
- No one can interact with a Space unless a Tool has been placed
- Once a Tool is placed, the Space switches from "Dormant" to "Active" in system logic
- Students automatically join some Spaces (e.g., dorm, major) and can request access to others

│   ├── Residential: Dorm floor size (~40-60 members)
│   ├── Academic: Course section size (~30-120 members)
│   ├── Cultural/Org: 500 member default cap
│   └── System: Unlimited (Campus-Wide, New Students 2025)
├── Overflow Management:
│   ├── UX: "This Space is full. Request preview access or follow for updates."
│   ├── Popular orgs spawn Overflow Spaces ("ASA – Freshman Cohort")
│   ├── Automatic overflow Space creation at 90% capacity
│   └── Cross-reference between main and overflow Spaces
└── Long-Term Scaling:
    ├── Shard large orgs into Tool-Federated Subspaces

    ├── Unified discovery but distributed membership
    └── Builder coordination across federated Space network
```

### ♻️ Space Lifecycle Management
