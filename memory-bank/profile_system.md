# HIVE vBETA - Profile System Documentation

_Last Updated: January 2025_  
_Status: Implementation Ready_

## 1. System Overview

**Strategic Role:** Profile is the behavioral intelligence collection engine that transforms individual student actions into platform-wide coordination insights while maintaining privacy and user agency.

**Core Philosophy:** "Every interaction teaches the platform how to better coordinate campus life, while students maintain complete control over their data and privacy."

## 4. Implementation Priority & Dependencies

**Implementation Priority:** Critical - Foundation system for vBETA behavioral platform
**Dependencies:** Authentication system, Data storage infrastructure, Privacy compliance framework
**Timeline Impact:** 2-3 weeks additional development for governance systems and privacy controls
**Risk Mitigation:** Comprehensive privacy controls and data governance prevent compliance issues

### Critical Implementation Decisions Locked:

1. **Motion Log Scope:** Auto-log Tool/Event/Space activity, manual-entry for housing/academic
2. **Privacy Boundaries:** Private Motion Logs, Builder Tool analytics only, aggregated sharing
3. **Builder Pipeline:** Tool placement + onboarding, fast-track for RAs/OLs, 14-day activity requirement
4. **Academic Integration:** Manual course entry, Space unlocking based on major/schedule
5. **Notifications:** Smart defaults with granular controls, 3/day max with batching
6. **Completion Incentives:** Utility-based unlocks, progressive disclosure, behind-the-scenes scoring
7. **Behavioral Intelligence:** Anonymized aggregate patterns, coordination impact scoring
8. **Profile Evolution:** Flexible updates, alumni mode, seasonal status management
9. **Social Integration:** Emergent connections through shared behavior, no friend requests
10. **Data Governance:** Student ownership, 1-year retention, FERPA compliance, no third-party sharing

### vBETA Scope Reductions:

- No institutional API integration or registrar access

## 4. Implementation Priority & Dependencies

**Implementation Priority:** Critical - Foundation system for vBETA behavioral platform
**Dependencies:** Authentication system, Data storage infrastructure, Privacy compliance framework
**Timeline Impact:** 2-3 weeks additional development for governance systems and privacy controls
**Risk Mitigation:** Comprehensive privacy controls and data governance prevent compliance issues

### Critical Implementation Decisions Locked:

1. **Motion Log Scope:** Auto-log Tool/Event/Space activity, manual-entry for housing/academic
2. **Privacy Boundaries:** Private Motion Logs, Builder Tool analytics only, aggregated sharing
3. **Builder Pipeline:** Tool placement + onboarding, fast-track for RAs/OLs, 14-day activity requirement
4. **Academic Integration:** Manual course entry, Space unlocking based on major/schedule
5. **Notifications:** Smart defaults with granular controls, 3/day max with batching
6. **Completion Incentives:** Utility-based unlocks, progressive disclosure, behind-the-scenes scoring
7. **Behavioral Intelligence:** Anonymized aggregate patterns, coordination impact scoring
8. **Profile Evolution:** Flexible updates, alumni mode, seasonal status management
9. **Social Integration:** Emergent connections through shared behavior, no friend requests
10. **Data Governance:** Student ownership, 1-year retention, FERPA compliance, no third-party sharing

### vBETA Scope Reductions:

- No institutional API integration or registrar access
- No passive location tracking or GPS data collection
- No GPA or academic performance monitoring
- No complex social networking features or friend systems
- No advanced analytics dashboards for students

### Post-vBETA Evolution Path:

- Advanced behavioral pattern recognition and AI insights
- Institutional partnership and data integration options
- Enhanced social coordination and community building features
- Advanced privacy controls and data portability options
- Cross-campus behavioral intelligence and coordination optimization

**Final Assessment:** This governance framework creates a privacy-first behavioral intelligence engine that respects student agency while generating the coordination insights needed to make HIVE a smarter platform over time.
