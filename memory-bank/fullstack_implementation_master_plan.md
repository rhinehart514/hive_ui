2. **Profile System** → Spaces auto-join (onboarding data needed)
3. **Spaces System** → Events, Feed, Builder (community foundation)
4. **Events System** → Feed traces (social aftermath content)
5. **Feed System** → Builder attribution (recognition loop)
6. **Builder System** → HiveLAB (tool creation platform)
7. **Integration** → All systems (unified experience)

### **Parallel Development Tracks**
- **Frontend Development** (Flutter UI and business logic)
- **Backend Functions** (RSS processing, surge detection, analytics)
- **Content Preparation** (Space seeding, tool templates, Builder recruitment)
- **Testing & QA** (Continuous testing throughout development)

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Weekly integration checkpoints** to catch system conflicts early
- **Performance testing** at each sprint completion
