# HIVE vBETA Beautiful Design System Implementation Checklist

_Last Updated: January 2025_  
_Purpose: Create a premium, beautiful design system for **WEB FIRST** with mobile-ready foundation_  
_Approach: React/Next.js priority with Flutter-ready architecture_  
_Status: **RESTARTED** with correct HIVE brand colors and locked tech stack alignment_

---

## üö® **DESIGN SYSTEM RESTART COMPLETE**

**CRITICAL UPDATE:** Design system has been completely restarted to align with:
- ‚úÖ **Official HIVE Brand Colors:** #0A0A0A background, #FFD700 sacred gold
- ‚úÖ **Locked Tech Stack:** React 19 + Next.js 15 + shadcn/ui + CVA + Framer Motion 11
- ‚úÖ **Memory Bank Alignment:** All colors and tokens from memory-bank/brand_aesthetic.md
- ‚úÖ **CSS Foundation:** Complete HIVE design system in apps/web/app/globals.css
- ‚úÖ **Tailwind Configuration:** Updated with HIVE tokens and spacing system

---

## üéØ **WEB-FIRST DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY**

### **Primary Focus: React/Next.js Web Platform**
- **Primary Platform:** React/Next.js web application 
- **Primary Users:** Students accessing HIVE via browser (desktop + mobile web)
- **Mobile Strategy:** Flutter foundation prepared but developed after web launch

### **Why Web-First:**
- **Faster Development:** Single platform focus enables rapid iteration
- **Broader Access:** All students can access via any device with a browser
- **Builder Tools:** HiveLAB tool creation works best on desktop/laptop interfaces
- **Testing & Feedback:** Easier to iterate and gather user feedback on web
- **Future Mobile:** React components translate design patterns to Flutter later
