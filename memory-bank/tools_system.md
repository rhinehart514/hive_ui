# HIVE vBETA - Tools System Documentation

_Last Updated: January 2025_  
_Status: Implementation Ready_

## 1. System Overview

**Strategic Role:** Tools are modular coordination mechanisms that transform dormant Spaces into active communities through student-created behavioral infrastructure.

**Core Philosophy:** "Every Tool must solve real coordination problems while generating behavioral intelligence that makes the platform smarter over time."

## 4. Tool System Governance & Operations (vBETA Locked Decisions)

### 🧠 Tool Ownership & Attribution

```
TOOL OWNERSHIP FRAMEWORK
├── Ownership Transfer Model:

│   ├── Once placed in Space, ownership transfers to placing Builder
│   ├── Original creator retains attribution but loses edit control
│   └── Fork lineage and attribution remain visible in HiveLAB
├── Edit Access Control:
│   ├── Only placing Builder can modify Tool within the Space
│   ├── Forking remains possible for others without affecting placed instances
│   ├── Tool configuration locked to prevent unauthorized changes
│   └── Edit history and change tracking for accountability
├── Graduation & Builder Exit:
│   ├── Created Tools persist as forkable templates
│   ├── Placed Tools remain active but lose edit access
│   ├── New Builder replacement required for continued management
│   └── Tool succession planning for critical coordination Tools
├── Malicious Behavior Prevention:
│   ├── Misuse scoped to Builder permissions within Space
│   ├── Admin override only for systemic abuse cases
│   ├── Localized moderation sufficient for most issues
│   └── Tool vandalism handled through Builder accountability
└── Tool Transfer Mechanism (v1):
    ├── "Tool Transfer" flow for Builder-to-Builder ownership change
    ├── Full audit log and attribution preservation
    ├── Recipient Builder confirmation required
    └── Community notification of ownership transfer
```

## 5. Implementation Priority & Dependencies

**Implementation Priority:** Critical - Core system for vBETA behavioral platform
**Dependencies:** Spaces system, Profile system, Builder management infrastructure
**Timeline Impact:** 3-4 weeks additional development for governance systems
**Risk Mitigation:** Comprehensive sandboxing and moderation prevent system abuse

### Critical Implementation Decisions Locked:

1. **Tool Ownership:** Placing Builder owns Tool instance, original creator retains attribution
2. **Performance Limits:** Runtime sandboxing with resource caps and auto-decay for violations
3. **Moderation:** Builder-scoped with community flagging and admin escalation
4. **Versioning:** Immutable placement model, forking for updates
5. **Analytics:** Role-based access with privacy protection
6. **Ecosystem:** Template approval process, Custom Tool freedom
7. **Security:** Confined sandbox environment with comprehensive monitoring
8. **Integration:** Tool isolation in vBETA, future chaining capabilities
9. **Economy:** Symbolic recognition system with Builder attribution
10. **Quality:** Community-driven standards with automated deprecation

### vBETA Scope Reductions:

- No Tool-to-Tool interactions or dependencies
- No custom API endpoints or external integrations
- No monetary rewards or complex economy features
- No advanced analytics dashboards for Builders
- No cross-Tool data sharing or trigger chains

### Post-vBETA Evolution Path:

- Tool chaining and conditional activation
- Advanced Builder analytics and insights
- External API integration framework
