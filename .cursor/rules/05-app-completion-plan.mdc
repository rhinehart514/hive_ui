# HIVE App Completion Plan Adherence

Every implementation must align with the roadmap defined in [docs/app_completion_plan.md](mdc:docs/app_completion_plan.md). Before writing code for any feature, always review the relevant sections in the plan to ensure consistency with user journeys, feature checklists, technical architecture, and prioritization.

## Enforcement Guidelines
- Consult the three-tab user journeys and E2E completion slices prior to development.
- Validate each feature against the plan's **Critical Path Items**.
- Reference **Tab Progress** and **Layer Progress** metrics to scope and prioritize work.
- Align code organization with the plan's modular architecture (Feed, Spaces, Profile).
- Ensure compliance with **Technical Architecture Adherence** for patterns, stack choices, and repository structures.
- Update the plan's completion statuses as tasks are implemented and verified.
