   - Provides a cleaner UI and follows common messaging app patterns

3. **Navigation Bar Styling**
   - Refined gold indicator for selected tab (thinner, wider, more elegant)
   - Improved spacing for better visual hierarchy 
   - Enhanced animations with spring physics for a more natural feel

4. **Icon System Integration**
   - Implemented consistent icon system using AppIcons
   - Set up for Hugeicons integration across the platform

## Implementation Details

### Bottom Navigation Bar
The bottom navigation bar has been redesigned with the following features:
- Smooth animations with spring effects
- Subtle haptic feedback when switching tabs
- Gold indicator pill for the selected tab
- Three main navigation destinations (Home, Spaces, Profile)

### Messages Button in Header
The Messages functionality has been relocated to the app header:
- Icon positioned in the top-right corner
- Gold notification indicator for unread messages
- Direct navigation to the Messages screen
- Haptic feedback on tap

### Hugeicons Integration
To ensure consistent icon usage across the platform:
- Created centralized AppIcons class in lib/theme/app_icons.dart
- Set up a migration path from Material Icons to Hugeicons
- Applied consistent styling for all icons

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
- Use AppIcons class for all icon references instead of direct icon imports
- Ensure appropriate haptic feedback is applied for navigation actions
- Maintain the 3-tab structure in the bottom navigation bar

### Design Principles
- Gold accents should be used sparingly for emphasis and selected states
- Follow the established visual hierarchy for navigation elements
- Maintain a clean, minimalist aesthetic with focused touch targets
- Apply subtle animations for transitions but avoid overuse

## Future Enhancements
- Complete migration to Hugeicons throughout the platform
- Further refine animations for smoother transitions
- Implement additional haptic feedback patterns for different interaction types
