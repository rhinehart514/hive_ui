# Archived Brand Aesthetics Documentation

These files have been archived as of March 29, 2024, and are no longer considered current or authoritative.

## Important Notice

All brand aesthetics information has been consolidated into a single source of truth:

**Current Documentation: [`/lib/docs/brand_aesthetic.md`](../../brand_aesthetic.md)**

## Why These Files Were Archived

1. To eliminate confusion from multiple, potentially contradictory sources
2. To establish a clear, single reference for brand aesthetics
3. To support the updated design system with new color palette and principles:
   - Background color changed to #0A0A0A (from pure black)
   - Secondary text color #BFBFBF introduced
   - Yellow usage clarified as cognitive signal only
   - New spatial layering system implemented
   - Updated glassmorphism specifications

The following files are maintained for historical reference only:

- `component_style_guide.md` - Former component styling approach
- `glassmorphism_design_system.md` - Original glassmorphism implementation
- `theme_documentation.md` - Previous theme definitions
