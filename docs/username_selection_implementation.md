# Username Selection Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the Username Selection step in the HIVE onboarding flow.

## Overview

The Username Selection feature allows users to choose a unique username during the onboarding process. This username is used for:

- User identification in the app
- Profile URL/handle (e.g., @username)
- Mentions in comments and discussions

## Architecture

Following HIVE's clean architecture principles:

### Data Layer
- `UsernameVerificationService`: Handles username format validation and availability checks
- Updated `ProfileSubmissionService`: Includes username in profile submission

### Domain Layer
- Updated `OnboardingState`: Added username field and validation logic
- Updated `UserProfile`: Added username field to the entity

### Presentation Layer
- `UsernamePage`: UI for username input with real-time validation
- Integration with `OnboardingPageView` in the flow sequence
- Animated validation feedback and availability indicators

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components

1. **Username Format Validation**
   - Minimum 3 characters
   - Maximum 20 characters
   - Only letters, numbers, and underscores
   - Must start with a letter

2. **Availability Checking**
   - Debounced API calls during typing
   - Visual indicators for checking/available/taken states
   - Error animation and haptic feedback for taken usernames

3. **Error Handling**
   - Animated shake effects for validation errors
   - Haptic feedback for errors
   - Clear, user-friendly error messages

4. **UI/UX Details**
   - Follows HIVE dark theme with gold accents
   - Uses standard input component with custom styling
   - Real-time validation with appropriate state management
   - Username requirements displayed for guidance

## Testing

Unit tests cover:
- Username format validation
- Username availability checking
- State management for the username field

## Firestore Integration

The username is stored in the user's profile document in Firestore, allowing for:
- Username uniqueness enforcement via Firestore security rules
- Username lookup for user discovery
- Username display across the app

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Add suggested usernames based on name/email
- Implement username change functionality (with limitations)
- Add profanity filtering and reserved username protection
