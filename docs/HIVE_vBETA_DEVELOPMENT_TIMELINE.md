## üîÑ POST-LAUNCH WEEKLY ITERATIONS

### **Week 1 (June 2-8): Builder Activation Focus**
```
üìä METRICS TO WATCH:
- Builder opt-in rate during onboarding
- First Tool placement completion rate
- Space activation frequency
- Tool interaction rates

üîß DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES:
- Tool interaction analytics implementation
- Builder activity feed prototype
- Tool performance dashboard
- Enhanced Tool templates (2-3 additional)

üéØ LEARNING GOALS:
- Do students understand Builder value prop?
- Which Template Tools get used most?
- How quickly do Spaces get activated?
- What blocks Tool placement completion?
```

### **Week 2 (June 9-15): Motion Intelligence**
```
üìä METRICS TO WATCH:
- Calendar daily usage rates
- Stack Tools adoption patterns
- Motion Log engagement
- Now Panel click-through rates

üîß DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES:
- Now Panel intelligence improvements
- Motion Log filtering capabilities
- Calendar visual enhancements
- Stack Tool variations (new types)

üéØ LEARNING GOALS:
- Is Calendar the engagement anchor we expected?
- Which Stack Tools drive retention?
- How often do students check Motion Log?
- What Now Panel content drives action?
```

### **Week 3-4 (June 16-29): Optimization & Expansion**
```
üìä METRICS TO WATCH:
- Daily active user rates
- Feature completion rates
- User journey drop-off points
- Space activity distribution

üîß DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES:
- Performance optimizations based on usage
- UI improvements from user feedback
- Additional Tool templates
- Tool forking functionality introduction

üéØ LEARNING GOALS:
- What's the natural user retention curve?
- Which features aren't being discovered?
- How do power users vs casual users differ?
- Are dormant Spaces problematic or expected?
```

### **Week 5-8 (July): Orientation Integration**
```
üìä NEW COHORT METRICS:
- Freshman onboarding completion rates
- International student engagement
- Summer orientation event participation
- Cross-cohort interaction patterns

üîß DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES:
- Freshman-specific onboarding flow
- Orientation event integration
- International student Space types
- Calendar import utilities (if needed)

üéØ LEARNING GOALS:
- How do incoming students use HIVE differently?
- What orientation-specific Tools are needed?
- Can HIVE replace other orientation platforms?
- How do summer cohorts differ from fall cohorts?
```

### **Week 9-12 (August): Social Layer Emergence**
```
üìä CRITICAL DECISIONS:
- Should Feed surface be introduced?
- Are Connect/Seen mechanics needed?
- How visible should Builder activity be?
- What social features drive retention?

üîß DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES:
- Social surface prototype (if validated)
- PromptPost visibility options
- Connect/Seen mechanics (if pursuing)
- Public profile elements (if needed)

üéØ LEARNING GOALS:
- Do students want more social features?
- How important is discovery vs curation?
- What level of social visibility feels right?
- Can the platform sustain without traditional social?
```

## üçÇ FALL READINESS (September 2025)

### **By September 1, HIVE Must Support:**
```
‚úÖ Scalable social layer (format TBD based on summer learning)
‚úÖ Robust Builder ecosystem with active Tool creation
‚úÖ Calendar integration with full academic year rhythm
‚úÖ Proven engagement loops beyond novelty effect
‚úÖ Clear onboarding for main fall cohort
‚úÖ Established Space activation patterns
‚úÖ Tool ecosystem that supports real student needs
```

### **Success Criteria for vBETA‚ÜíV1 Transition:**
```
- 70%+ of active Spaces have at least one placed Tool
- 20%+ of students have opted into Builder status
- Daily Calendar usage by 60%+ of active users
- Proven 4-week retention rate >40%
- Clear product-market fit signal for at least one core system
- Validated social layer approach (whatever form it takes)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISK MITIGATION

### **Technical Risks:**
- **Tool System Complexity:** Start with simple templates, expand gradually
- **Space Auto-Assignment:** Have manual override and fallback options
- **Calendar Performance:** Optimize for mobile-first, limit event quantities

### **Product Risks:**
- **Builder Adoption:** Have backup plan for seeding Builders if organic adoption fails
- **Social Layer:** Keep multiple prototypes ready based on summer learning
- **Engagement:** Build engagement hooks into Calendar and Stack Tools as fallbacks

### **Timeline Risks:**
- **Late May Launch:** Have minimal viable launch version ready by May 24
- **Weekly Iterations:** Prioritize learning over shipping if needed
- **Fall Readiness:** Start fall preparation by August 1 regardless of summer learnings

This timeline balances shipping functional value quickly with the flexibility to learn and iterate based on real student behavior.
