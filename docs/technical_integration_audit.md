## Integration Testing Approach

For each integration point, implement:

1. **Unit tests** for isolated component functionality
2. **Integration tests** for key data flows
3. **End-to-end tests** for critical user paths
4. **Manual verification** for complex interactions

## Resolving Integration Issues

When issues are discovered:

1. Isolate the problem to specific components
2. Verify data structures match expected formats
3. Check timing/race conditions in asynchronous flows
4. Ensure proper error handling at integration points
5. Update integration tests to prevent regression

## Conclusion

This technical integration audit ensures that all components of the HIVE platform work together seamlessly. Addressing these integration points is critical for a production-ready application. Regular integration testing should be performed as new features are added or existing features are modified.

Each integration point should be verified before launch and included in regression testing for future updates.
