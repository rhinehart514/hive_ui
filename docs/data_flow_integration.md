# HIVE App Data Flow Integration Verification

## Overview

This document outlines the critical data flows across the HIVE platform's three-layer architecture (data, domain, presentation) and provides a verification framework to ensure seamless integration for launch readiness. It serves as a comprehensive checklist for testing end-to-end behavior according to the business logic requirements.

## Architecture Layers

### Data Layer (95% Complete)
- Repositories, data models, DTOs
- Firebase infrastructure (Firestore collections, security rules)
- Data validation and transformation

### Domain Layer (80% Complete)
- Business logic and use cases
- Entities and value objects
- State management and workflow policies

### Presentation Layer (85% Complete)
- UI components and screens
- User interaction handling
- State representation and visualization

## Critical Data Flow Paths

### 1. Identity & Role Management Flow

#### Data Path: Authentication → Role Assignment → Permission Enforcement
| Starting Point | Flow Path | End Result |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| User Registration | `AuthRepository` → `UserEntity` → `RoleService` → `PermissionEnforcement` | User assigned correct role with appropriate permissions |

**Integration Points:**
- Firebase Auth → Firestore User Document
- User Document → Role Entity
- Role Entity → UI Permission Controls
- Role Status → Feature Availability

**Verification Tests:**
- [ ] New user registration creates proper User document with "Public" role
- [ ] Email verification updates role to "Verified" 
- [ ] Role changes propagate immediately to UI controls
- [ ] Permission checks block unauthorized actions at all layers
- [ ] Firestore rules prevent document access based on role

### 2. Space Management Flow

#### Data Path: Space Creation → Membership → Content Creation Rights
| Starting Point | Flow Path | End Result |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Space Creation | `SpaceRepository` → `SpaceEntity` → `MembershipService` → `ContentCreationRights` | Space properly created with correct permissions and visibility |

**Integration Points:**
- Space Document → Space Entity
- Space Entity → UI Representation
- Space Membership → Event Creation Rights
- Space State → Feed Visibility

**Verification Tests:**
- [ ] Only Verified users can create Spaces
- [ ] Space lifecycle states transition correctly (Created → Active → Dormant → Archived)
- [ ] Leadership claim process updates role correctly
- [ ] Space membership controls access to creation features
- [ ] Public/Private visibility settings properly limit discovery
- [ ] Space appears in correct searches and recommendations

### 3. Event Lifecycle Flow

#### Data Path: Event Creation → State Transitions → Feed Visibility
| Starting Point | Flow Path | End Result |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Event Creation | `EventRepository` → `EventEntity` → `EventLifecycleService` → `FeedVisibilitySystem` | Event appears in feed with appropriate visibility based on state |

**Integration Points:**
- Event Document → Event Entity
- Event Entity → Feed Card
- Event State → UI Controls
- Event Engagement → Analytics Collection

**Verification Tests:**
- [ ] Event creation restricted to Space members with proper permissions
- [ ] State transitions work automatically based on time (Published → Live → Completed)
- [ ] Events appear in feed with correct UI treatment (normal, boosted, honey mode)
- [ ] RSVP actions update both event stats and user's saved events
- [ ] Completed events trigger analytics collection
- [ ] Archived events move to proper storage/accessibility state

### 4. Feed Personalization Flow

#### Data Path: User Actions → Interaction Memory → Feed Ranking
| Starting Point | Flow Path | End Result |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| User Interaction | `UserActionRepository` → `InteractionMemoryService` → `FeedRankingSystem` | Personalized feed reflecting user preferences |

**Integration Points:**
- User Actions → Interaction Memory
- Interaction Memory → Personalization Scoring
- Feed Algorithm → UI Card Presentation
- Signal Strip Integration

**Verification Tests:**
- [ ] User actions (RSVP, view, follow) are recorded properly
- [ ] Feed scoring incorporates user preferences
- [ ] Followed spaces have guaranteed visibility
- [ ] Feed changes based on time proximity to events
- [ ] Signal strip correctly highlights relevant content
- [ ] Honey mode and boosted content appear with proper UI treatment

### 5. Moderation & Reporting Flow

#### Data Path: User Report → Moderation Queue → Enforcement Action
| Starting Point | Flow Path | End Result |
|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Content Report | `ReportRepository` → `ModerationService` → `EnforcementSystem` | Appropriate action taken on reported content |

**Integration Points:**
- Report UI → Report Document
- Report Document → Moderation Queue
- Moderation Decision → Content State Changes
- Moderation Action → User Notification

**Verification Tests:**
- [ ] Report UI accessible from appropriate content
- [ ] Reports correctly captured and stored
- [ ] Moderation queue properly displays reported items
- [ ] Enforcement actions properly update content state
- [ ] Users notified of moderation outcomes

## End-to-End Verification Scenarios

### Critical User Journeys

#### 1. New User Onboarding & Verification
