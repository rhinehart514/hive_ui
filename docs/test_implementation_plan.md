# Testing Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategy for the Hive UI application, covering different types of tests, their implementation approach, and priorities.

## Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests
Unit tests validate the smallest components in isolation, particularly business logic and data manipulation.

#### Implementation Priorities:
- [ ] Core utility functions
- [ ] State management logic (Providers and Notifiers)
- [ ] Repository implementations
- [ ] Data transformations
- [ ] Domain-specific use cases
- [ ] Error handling

#### Implementation Approach:
- Use the `flutter_test` package for basic testing infrastructure
- Use `mockito` for mocking dependencies
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
- Create test doubles for external dependencies
- Aim for high coverage of business logic (>80%)

### 2. Widget Tests
Widget tests validate UI components in isolation without requiring a full application environment.

#### Implementation Priorities:
- [ ] Core reusable widgets (buttons, cards, etc.)
- [ ] Feature-specific widgets (user profiles, posts, etc.) 
- [ ] Form validations
- [ ] Error displays
- [ ] Loading states

#### Implementation Approach:
- Use the `flutter_test` package
- Test both UI appearance and behavior
- Mock provider dependencies using `ProviderScope`
- Verify widget rendering in different states (loading, error, success)
- Test user interactions (taps, scrolls, data entry)

### 3. Integration Tests
Integration tests validate that different components work together correctly.

#### Implementation Priorities:
- [ ] Authentication flows
- [ ] Profile creation and editing
- [ ] Content creation and viewing
- [ ] Navigation between key screens
- [ ] End-to-end user journeys

#### Implementation Approach:
- Use the `integration_test` package
- Create real or realistic test data
- Focus on critical user journeys
- Minimize use of mocks in favor of test implementations
- Test application under realistic conditions

### 4. Golden Tests
Golden tests verify that the UI appearance matches expected visual references.

#### Implementation Priorities:
- [ ] Core theme components
- [ ] Critical UI screens
- [ ] Responsive layouts

#### Implementation Approach:
- Use the `golden_toolkit` package
- Create golden master images for key screens
- Test across different device sizes
- Update golden files when design changes are approved

## Mocking Strategy

### External Services
For Firebase and other external services:
- Create mock implementations with predictable behaviors
- Use `fake_cloud_firestore` for Firestore operations
- Create fake authentication services

### Network Requests
- Use `http_mock_adapter` or similar
- Define mock responses for API endpoints
- Test error handling with various status codes

## Test Organization

### Directory Structure
```

├── unit/
│   ├── core/
│   ├── features/
│   └── utils/
├── widget/
│   ├── core/
│   └── features/
├── integration/
│   └── journeys/
├── golden/
└── mocks/
    ├── services/
    ├── repositories/
    └── data/
```

### Naming Conventions
- Unit tests: `{class_name}_test.dart`
- Widget tests: `{widget_name}_test.dart`
- Integration tests: `{journey_name}_test.dart`
- Golden tests: `{screen_name}_golden_test.dart`

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Framework Setup
- [x] Set up basic test infrastructure
- [ ] Create core mocks for services
- [ ] Implement test helpers

### Phase 2: Unit Tests
- [ ] Core utilities and services
- [ ] User authentication and profile
- [ ] Feed and content features
- [ ] Error handling

### Phase 3: Widget Tests
- [ ] Core components
- [ ] Profile components
- [ ] Content components
- [ ] Navigation components

### Phase 4: Integration and Golden Tests
- [ ] Authentication flows
- [ ] Profile management
- [ ] Content creation
- [ ] Golden tests for key screens

## Best Practices

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent and not rely on the state from previous tests.
2. **Descriptive Names**: Test names should describe the expected behavior.
3. **Setup/Teardown**: Use `setUp` and `tearDown` methods to prepare and clean test environments.
4. **Test Data**: Create helper functions for generating test data.
5. **Coverage**: Regularly check code coverage to identify untested areas.
6. **CI Integration**: Ensure tests run on every pull request.
7. **Performance**: Keep tests efficient, especially widget and integration tests.

## Tools and Libraries

- `flutter_test`: Core testing framework
- `mockito`: Mocking library
- `faker`: Generate realistic test data
- `network_image_mock`: Mock network images
- `fake_cloud_firestore`: Test Firestore operations
- `golden_toolkit`: Golden test utilities
- `integration_test`: End-to-end testing

## Conclusion
This testing plan aims to provide a comprehensive approach to ensuring the quality of the Hive UI application. By implementing tests at all levels, we can catch issues early, maintain code quality, and ensure a smooth user experience.
