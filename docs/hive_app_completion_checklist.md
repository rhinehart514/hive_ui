# HIVE App Completion Checklist

This checklist tracks all development tasks needed to ship HIVE, the ultimate campus life platform. Messaging features are tracked separately in `messaging_completion_checklist.md`.

## PRIORITY NOTE: Core Functionality and Integration

Based on the HIVE_OVERVIEW.md document, our top priority is ensuring that all screens have complete functionality and are properly integrated with each other. The HIVE platform's strength comes from the seamless connections between features:

1. **Feed ↔ Spaces Integration**: Events and content from Spaces you follow must appear in the Feed
2. **Spaces ↔ Events Integration**: Events created in Spaces must be discoverable in their own context and the Feed
3. **Profiles ↔ Spaces Integration**: User profiles must show joined Spaces, and Space profiles must show members
4. **Profiles ↔ Events Integration**: RSVPing must add events to profiles, and profiles must show event participation

While UI polish and micro-interactions will enhance the experience, the functionality and cross-feature integration takes precedence to deliver the core value proposition of HIVE as a unified campus experience.
