# HIVE vBETA Build Requirements

*Strategic Foundation for Late May 2025 Launch*

## ðŸš€ LAUNCH CRITICAL (MUST SHIP)

These systems must be fully functional for vBETA launch. Students need immediate value on first open.

### **1. PROFILE SYSTEM - Core Dashboard**

#### **Calendar Tool (Priority 1)**
```
- Manual event entry (title, time, location)
- Quiet Hours blocks (visual calendar overlay)
- Stack Tool integration (Reminders appear as calendar items)

- Week view primary, month view secondary
- NO external calendar sync (Google/iCal) for vBETA
```

#### **Motion Log (Priority 1)**
```

- Infinite scroll, most recent first
```

#### **Stack Tools (Priority 1)**

- All tools are personal, non-shareable in vBETA
```

#### **Now Panel (Priority 2)**
```
- Dynamic banner showing today's activity
- Examples: "1 event today", "Tool active again", "New Space activity"
- Updates based on Calendar events and motion state changes
- Simple text display, no complex graphics needed for launch
```

```

#### **Auto-Assignment Logic (Priority 1)**
```

```

#### **Basic Space Surfaces (Priority 1)**
```

- Posts: Hidden until PromptPost Tool is placed
- Chat: Locked with "Coming in v0.1.1" message
```

#### **Space Activation Flow (Priority 2)**
```
- Builder places first Tool â†’ Space becomes "activated"
- UI changes from preview to live mode
- Member notifications about activation
- Tool interaction becomes live
```

### **3. HIVELAB SYSTEM - Builder Engine**

#### **Builder Onboarding (Priority 1)**
```
- Opt-in flow during initial onboarding OR from Profile

```
