## 7. Metrics & Analytics

*   **Event Detail View Rate:** (# Users viewing any Event Detail screen) / (# Users encountering Event Cards).
*   **RSVP Rate (from Details):** (# RSVP actions from Details screen) / (# Event Detail views).
*   **Host Profile Click Rate:** (# Taps on host link) / (# Event Detail views).
*   **Feature Usage:** Clicks on Map View, Add to Calendar, Share.
*   **Analytics Events:** (Listed in Sequence section)

## 8. Design/UX Notes

*   Clear hierarchy: Event Name, Time, Location, and RSVP action should be most prominent.
*   Readability of description is important.
*   **(Q4):** Attendee count provides social proof post-RSVP; hiding it initially encourages commitment.
*   RSVP cancel flow via bottom drawer prevents accidental cancellations.
*   **(Q5):** "Add to Calendar" provides utility and external commitment.
