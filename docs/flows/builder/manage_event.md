## 1. Title & Goal

*   **Title:** Builder Manage Event Details & Attendees
*   **Goal:** Allow a user with Builder permissions for an Event (the Host) to modify event details, view/manage the attendee list, and perform other administrative actions like cancelling the event.

---

## 2. Persona & Prerequisites

*   **Persona:** Builder (Host of the specific Event, likely Admin of the host Space)
*   **Prerequisites:**
    *   User is logged in and has hosting permissions for the target Event.
    *   The Event exists.
    *   User is viewing the Event Detail screen for the event they host.
        *   ‚ùì **Q1:** Where is the entry point for accessing event management tools located on the Event Detail screen for hosts?
        *   ‚úÖ **A1:** A **three-dot menu (¬∑¬∑¬∑)** in the top-right corner, visible only to the Host. Tapping reveals options: `‚úèÔ∏è Edit Event`, `üìã View RSVPs`, `‚ùå Cancel Event`.

---

## 3. Sequence (High-Level - Specific actions TBD)

*   **Trigger:** Host identifies the need to manage their event.
*   **System Action:** Host accesses management tools/options via the defined entry point (Q1).
*   **Screen(s):** Event Management View / Edit Form / Attendee List
    *   ‚ùì **Q2:** Is editing done via the same form as creation, or a separate interface? Is attendee management a separate screen?
    *   ‚úÖ **A2:** Editing uses the **same scrollable form interface as creation**, pre-filled with data. `View RSVPs` leads to a separate attendee list screen.
*   **User Action:** Host selects an action (e.g., Edit Details, View Attendees, Cancel Event).
*   **User Action:** Host makes changes (e.g., updates description, removes an attendee).
*   **System Action:** Presents confirmation where necessary (e.g., Cancel Event, Remove Attendee).
*   **User Action:** Host confirms action.
*   **System Action:** Processes request (API call), provides feedback.
