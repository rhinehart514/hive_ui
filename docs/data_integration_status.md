# HIVE Data Integration Status Checklist

## Overview

This document tracks the status of data integration between the three layers of the HIVE application (Data, Domain, Presentation). It identifies disconnected or incomplete data flows that must be addressed before testing.

## Integration Status Legend
- ✅ **Complete** - Integration fully implemented and verified
- 🟡 **Partial** - Basic integration exists but has limitations or edge cases not handled
- ❌ **Missing** - Integration not implemented
- ⚠️ **Blocked** - Dependent on another component

## 4. Feed System Integration

### Data → Domain Integration

## 5. Moderation & Reporting Integration

### Data → Domain Integration
| Connection Point | Status | Notes |
|------------------|--------|-------|
| `ReportRepository` → Moderation System | ❌ | Report storage exists but not connected to moderation logic |
| Moderation Actions → Enforcement | ❌ | Actions defined but not connected to content state changes |
| Report Analytics → Domain Logic | ❌ | No collection of reporting patterns for domain decisions |

### Domain → Presentation Integration
| Connection Point | Status | Notes |
|------------------|--------|-------|
| Report Creation → UI Flow | 🟡 | Basic report UI exists but submission not fully connected |
| Moderation Queue → Admin UI | ❌ | Queue structure defined but no admin UI connection |
| Moderation Decisions → Content Updates | ❌ | No reflection of moderation decisions in content presentation |
| User Notifications for Reports | ❌ | Notification system not connected to moderation outcomes |

## 6. Cross-Feature Integration Status

| Integration Point | Status | Notes |

| Profile → Space Membership | 🟡 | Basic connection exists but updates not bidirectional |
| Space → Event Creation | 🟡 | Events linked to spaces but permissions not enforced |
| Event Activity → Space Analytics | ❌ | No reflection of event metrics in space analytics |
| User Activity → Feed Personalization | ❌ | User actions not influencing feed content |
| Role Changes → Permission Updates | ❌ | Role updates don't trigger permission recalculations |

## 7. Security Rule Implementation Status

| Security Component | Status | Notes |
|--------------------|--------|-------|

| Space Permission Enforcement | 🟡 | Basic ownership checks but not comprehensive permission model |
| Collection-Level Creation Rights | 🟡 | Some collections restricted but not comprehensive |
| Report Access Restrictions | ❌ | No protective rules for report data |

## Implementation Priorities

Based on the disconnection status, these are the critical integration points that should be addressed first:

### Highest Priority (Critical Path Functionality)
1. ❌ Role Entity → Permission System → UI Controls
2. ❌ Event Lifecycle State Transitions (Data → Domain → UI)
3. ❌ Space Management Permission Enforcement
4. ❌ Role-Based Security Rules Implementation

### High Priority (Core User Experience)
1. ❌ Feed Personalization and Visibility Systems
2. ❌ Space Membership → Event Creation Rights
3. ❌ Moderation System Connections
4. ❌ Cross-Feature Analytics Integration

### Medium Priority (Feature Enhancement)
1. ❌ Signal Strip Data Generation
2. ❌ Profile Connections to Spaces and Events
3. ❌ User Preference → System Behavior

## Next Steps

1. **Assign integration tasks** to developers based on the disconnection status
2. **Implement critical data flows** starting with the highest priority items
3. **Verify each connection** as it's completed and update this document
4. **Begin testing** once the critical path integrations are complete

This document should be updated as integration work progresses, with items moving from ❌ to 🟡 to ✅ as development continues.
