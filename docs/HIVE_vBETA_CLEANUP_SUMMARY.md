# HIVE vBETA Cleanup Summary

*Completed: May 30, 2025*

## Overview

This document summarizes the cleanup performed during HIVE's pivot from a task-based, feed-centric social network to the structured **Profile**, **Spaces**, and **HiveLAB** platform architecture for vBETA.

## Files Removed

### Task Management System
- ✅ `README-task-master.md` - Task management system documentation
- ✅ `tasks/tasks.json` - Main task tracking file (14KB, 222 lines)
- ✅ `tasks/` directory - Removed empty directory

### Outdated Product Documentation
- ✅ `HIVE_PRD.md` - Old V1 PRD with feed-centric approach
- ✅ `memory-bank/HIVE_PRD.md` - Duplicate PRD with task references
- ✅ `memory-bank/progress.md` - Task completion tracking
- ✅ `docs/app_completion_plan.md` - Core task planning document
- ✅ `docs/app_completion_plan_v2.md` - Updated task planning

### Consolidation Plans (Task-Based)
- ✅ `docs/clubs_spaces_consolidation_plan.md` - Task-based consolidation
- ✅ `docs/profile_consolidation_plan.md` - Task completion tracking
- ✅ `docs/directory_consolidation_implementation.md` - Task-based tracking
- ✅ `docs/phase1_implementation_status.md` - Phase-based implementation

## Files Created

### New Product Specifications
- ✅ `HIVE_vBETA_SPEC.md` - Complete vBETA product specification
- ✅ `HIVE_PRD.md` - New vBETA-aligned PRD
- ✅ `HIVE_vBETA_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - This cleanup summary

## Files Updated

### Design Documentation
- ✅ `HIVE_UI_UX_DESIGN_PLAN.md` - Removed task references, aligned with vBETA

## Remaining Work

### Files That Still Need Review
The following files may contain task references that should be reviewed and cleaned up:

1. **`docs/data_integration_status.md`** - Contains task assignment sections
2. **`docs/data_ui_integration_checklist.md`** - May have task-oriented content
3. **`docs/hive_ui_implementation_checklist.md`** - References app completion plan
4. **`docs/directory_structure_cleanup_plan.md`** - References task-based planning
5. **`memory-bank/ui_ux_guidelines.md`** - May reference removed app completion plan

### Code Architecture Review Needed
Review the codebase for:
- Feed-centric code that should be deferred
- Social networking features that don't align with vBETA
- Task-related functionality in the app itself

## vBETA Focus Areas

Going forward, all development should focus on:

1. **Profile System** - Behavioral dashboard, motion log, calendar integration
2. **Spaces System** - Builder-activated group surfaces, Tool placement
3. **HiveLAB System** - Tool composer, Builder dashboard, experiments

## Key References

- **Primary Spec:** [HIVE_vBETA_SPEC.md](mdc:HIVE_vBETA_SPEC.md)
- **Technical Architecture:** [memory-bank/hive_architecture.md](mdc:memory-bank/hive_architecture.md)
- **Product Vision:** [memory-bank/hive.md](mdc:memory-bank/hive.md)
- **Brand Guidelines:** [memory-bank/brand_aesthetic.md](mdc:memory-bank/brand_aesthetic.md)

## Critical Mindset Shift

**OLD:** Feed-centric social network with task-based development
**NEW:** Structured behavioral platform where community is earned through Tool-driven interactions

The feed is not missing—it's waiting to be earned through Builder experimentation and student engagement patterns in the three core systems.
