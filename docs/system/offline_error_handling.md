## 1. Title & Goal

*   **Title:** System Offline & Error Handling
*   **Goal:** Define the baseline approach for handling network connectivity issues, offline scenarios, general errors, and mandatory app updates in V1.

---

## 2. Scope

*   This document outlines the *general* system behavior. Specific error handling for core flows (like posting, liking, commenting, login, etc.) may be detailed further within those individual flow documents.

---

## 3. Sequence of Actions & Behaviors

### 3.1 Offline Mode
*   **Trigger:** Device loses network connectivity while the app is open or being launched.
*   **UI Indication:** A persistent banner appears at the top or bottom of the screen. (Q1.14.2)
    *   **Banner Text:** "Offline — syncing when connected" or similar. (Q1.14.2)
*   **Cached Content Viewing:**
    *   **Feed:** Previously loaded feed content remains visible in a cached state. Attempting to scroll beyond cached content may show an end-of-cache indicator or the offline banner. (Q1.14.1)
    *   **Other Screens:** Data loaded before going offline (e.g., profile details, space info) remains visible. Attempting to navigate to new, uncached areas will likely result in an error state (see 3.3).
*   **Offline Actions (Queuing):**
    *   **Posts/Comments:** Users can still compose posts and comments. (Q1.14.1)
    *   **Action Trigger:** Tapping "Post" or "Send".
    *   **UI Feedback:** The post/comment appears in the UI in a dimmed or visually distinct "Queued" state, possibly with a loading/pending icon. (Q1.14.2)
    *   **System Action:** The action data is saved locally in a queue.
    *   *Constraint:* Other actions (Likes, Follows, RSVPs, etc.) are likely disabled or fail immediately with an offline error message in V1, rather than being queued.
*   **Reconnecting:**
    *   **Trigger:** Device regains network connectivity.
    *   **System Action:** The offline banner disappears.
    *   **System Action:** Queued actions (posts, comments) are automatically submitted to the backend in the background.
    *   **UI Feedback:** Queued items transition from the pending state to the normal state upon successful submission. Failures might show an error state on the item, requiring user retry.

### 3.2 General Network Error Handling
*   **Trigger:** A network request for data loading or non-queued actions fails while the user *is* presumably online (e.g., transient error, server issue).
*   **UI Feedback:** A non-blocking **Snackbar** or Toast message appears. (Q1.14.3)
    *   **Message Text:** "Couldn't complete action. Retry?" or "Couldn't load data. Retry?" (Q1.14.3)
    *   **Action:** Includes a "Retry" button within the Snackbar/Toast where applicable.
*   **User Action:** User taps "Retry".
*   **System Action:** The failed network request is attempted again.
*   *Constraint:* Avoid using blocking modals for typical network errors. Reserve those for critical failures like login or mandatory updates.

### 3.3 Planned Maintenance
*   **Trigger:** The platform is undergoing scheduled maintenance.
*   **UI Indication:** A persistent banner is displayed at the top of the feed or relevant screens. (Q1.14.4)
    *   **Banner Text:** "Scheduled update in progress. Some features may be temporarily unavailable." (Q1.14.4)
*   **Behavior:** The app may remain partially functional (viewing cached data), or specific actions might fail with a maintenance message.

### 3.4 Forced Version Upgrade
*   **Trigger:** User launches the app with a version older than the minimum required version set by the backend.
*   **UI State:** A **full-screen blocking modal** appears immediately after launch, preventing further app usage. (Q1.14.4)
*   **Modal Content:**
    *   **Title:** "Update Required"
    *   **Message:** "Please update HIVE to the latest version to continue."
    *   **Action Button:** "Update Now" (linking directly to the App Store / Play Store page). (Q1.14.4)
*   **Behavior:** The user cannot dismiss the modal or use the app until they update.

*   **Analytics:** [`event: system.offline.detected`], [`event: system.offline.reconnected`], [`event: system.offline.action_queued {type}`], [`event: system.offline.queue_sync_started`], [`event: system.offline.queue_sync_completed {success_count, fail_count}`], [`event: system.error.network_displayed {context}`], [`event: system.error.maintenance_displayed`], [`event: system.error.force_upgrade_displayed`]

## 4. State Diagrams

*   (Diagram: Online -> Lose Connection -> Offline Banner + Cached View -> [Queue Action] -> Regain Connection -> Sync Queue -> Online)
*   (Diagram: Action Attempt (Online) -> Network Error -> Snackbar + Retry Option -> User Taps Retry -> Request Retried)
*   (Diagram: App Launch -> Check Version -> Old Version Detected -> Force Upgrade Modal -> User Taps Update -> App Store)

---

## 5. Error Scenarios (Summary)

*   **Offline:** Handled via caching, queuing (for posts/comments), and clear banner.
*   **Transient Network Errors:** Handled via non-blocking Snackbar with retry option.
*   **API Errors (Specific):** Handled within individual flow documents (e.g., revert optimistic UI, provide specific error message).
*   **Maintenance:** Handled via informational banner.
*   **Outdated Version:** Handled via blocking update modal.

---

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

*   Offline state is clearly indicated via banner (Q1.14.2).
*   Previously loaded feed content is viewable offline (Q1.14.1).
*   Posts/Comments can be composed offline and are queued (Q1.14.1, Q1.14.2).
*   Queued actions are synced automatically upon reconnection.
*   General network errors display a non-blocking Snackbar with a retry option (Q1.14.3).
*   Planned maintenance is indicated via a banner (Q1.14.4).
*   Outdated app versions trigger a blocking force update modal (Q1.14.4).

---

## 7. Metrics & Analytics

*   **Offline Usage Duration:** Time spent using the app while offline.
*   **Queued Action Volume:** Number of posts/comments created offline.
*   **Queue Sync Success Rate:** % of queued actions successfully synced.
*   **Network Error Frequency:** Rate of general network errors encountered.
*   **Force Update Screen View Rate:** % of launches triggering the update modal.
*   **Analytics Events:** (Listed in Sequence section)

---

## 8. Design/UX Notes

*   Offline indicators should be clear but not overly intrusive.
*   Queued item states need to be visually distinct.
*   Retry mechanisms should be easy to use.
*   Force update modal must be clear and provide a direct path to the store.

---

## 9. API Calls & Data

*   **(Client-Side Logic):** Primarily involves network status detection, local caching (e.g., using Hive DB, SQLite), and a local queue for offline actions.
*   **Version Check API Call:**
    *   **Request:** Client App Version.
    *   **Response:** Minimum Required Version, [Optional: Maintenance Status].

2.  **Offline Indication/Queue UI:** How is offline state shown? Queued items?
    *   ✅ **A1.14.2:** Banner ("Offline - syncing..."). Queued items dimmed w/ loading icon.
3.  **General Network Error UI:** How are non-posting network errors shown?
    *   ✅ **A1.14.3:** Non-blocking Snackbar: "Couldn't complete action. Retry?"
4.  **Maintenance/Upgrade UI:** How are maintenance and forced upgrades handled?
    *   ✅ **A1.14.4:** Maintenance: Top banner. Forced Upgrade: Full-block modal -> "Update to continue" w/ Store link.
