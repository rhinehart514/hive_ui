# Legacy Rules & Architecture Archive

This document contains the contents of previous architectural and rule-based files that have been superseded by the new, canonical `.cursorrules` file at the project root.

They are stored here to preserve any historical context or project knowledge that might be useful, but they should **not** be considered the current source of truth for any development work.
