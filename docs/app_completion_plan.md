      - [x] ✅ Analytics providers properly scoped with domain/data separation
      - [x] ✅ Repository adapter pattern implemented for spaces
      - [ ] 🔄 Need to review and update provider scoping in other features

#### Data Layer
- [x] ✅ **Repository Implementation**
  - [x] ✅ Abstract repository interfaces
  - [x] ✅ Data sources properly segregated
  - [x] ✅ Error handling with domain-specific failures
    - [x] ✅ Space implementation has domain-specific exceptions
    - [x] ✅ Feed implementation with Either type and domain failures
    - [x] ✅ Analytics implementation with proper error handling and logging
    - [x] ✅ Proper type handling between domain entities and models using mappers
    - [ ] 🔄 Need to expand error handling to other repository implementations

#### Navigation
- [ ] 🔄 **GoRouter Implementation**
  - [x] ✅ Route constants and definitions
  - [x] ✅ Navigation without BuildContext across async gaps
  - [x] ✅ Deep link handling

#### Error Handling
- [x] ✅ **Unified Error Approach**
  - [x] ✅ Consistent error reporting
  - [x] ✅ User-friendly error messages
  - [x] ✅ Crashlytics integration

#### Testing
- [x] ✅ Create test implementation plan
- [ ] 🔄 Implement unit tests for core features
  - [x] ✅ Set up repository interface tests
  - [ ] 🔄 Implement tests for business logic
  - [ ] 🔄 Add tests for provider implementations
  - [x] ✅ Create example tests without using build_runner
- [ ] 🔄 Add widget tests for UI components

#### Known Testing Issues

- 🛑 **build_runner conflicts**: Some files in the codebase contain UTF-8 encoding issues that prevent successful mock generation. Documented workarounds in `test/README.md` include using fake implementations instead of generated mocks.
- 🛑 **Event model compatibility**: The Event model has required fields that make testing complex. Consider adding factory methods or builders to simplify test object creation.
- ✅ **CI configuration**: GitHub Actions workflow successfully set up but needs repository-specific badge URL once the repository is properly configured.
- 🛑 **Type conversion**: Multiple Event types (domain entity vs model) exist in the codebase, requiring proper mapping using EventMapper. This adds complexity to testing.

## How to Use This Roadmap

This roadmap is structured as a checklist for shipping the HIVE platform. It organizes features by:

1. **Shipment Phase** - Features are organized by MVP (must-have), Enhancement (important), and Future (post-launch)
2. **Business Layer** - Features are categorized by the five core behavioral layers of HIVE
3. **Completion Status** - Clear tracking of implementation progress
4. **Technical Architecture** - Tracking adherence to the architecture guidelines in technical_architecture_guide.md

### Real-Time Tracking Instructions
1. **Update the Dashboard** at the top whenever you:
   - Start working on a new feature (update CURRENTLY BUILDING)
   - Complete a feature (add to RECENT COMPLETIONS)
   - Update your priorities (update NEXT UP and CRITICAL PATH)
   - Make progress on a section (update LAYER PROGRESS)
   - Implement architectural patterns (update ARCHITECTURAL COMPLIANCE)

2. **Check off items** in the detailed sections below as you complete them
   - Change status from 🟢 or 🔄 to ✅
   - Recalculate percentages using the formula at the bottom of this document

3. **Adjust the launch readiness** whenever significant progress is made

4. **Verify architectural adherence** for each feature as it's implemented
   - Confirm the feature follows clean architecture principles
   - Check that state management uses appropriate Riverpod patterns
   - Validate error handling and testing approaches

### Status Indicators
- [x] ✅ **Implemented** - Feature is fully implemented and tested
- [ ] 🔄 **In Progress** - Work has started but is not complete
- [ ] 🔍 **Needs Verification** - Requires clarification before implementation
- [ ] 🟢 **Ready** - All dependencies are satisfied; ready to implement
- [ ] 🔒 **Blocked** - Task is blocked by dependencies
