# HIVE Platform App Completion Plan

## How to Use This Plan

### Task Status Indicators
- [x] âœ… **Completed** - Task has been implemented and tested
- [ ] ðŸ”’ **Blocked** - Task is blocked by dependencies
- [ ] ðŸŸ¢ **Ready** - All dependencies are satisfied; task is ready to be worked on

### Dependency Rules
1. When marking a task as complete, add the âœ… emoji next to the checkbox
2. When a task is completed, review all tasks that depend on it and update their status from ðŸ”’ to ðŸŸ¢ if all dependencies are now met
3. Tasks with external dependencies (UI decisions, business logic decisions) remain ðŸ”’ until those decisions are made
4. New tasks should be marked as ðŸ”’ or ðŸŸ¢ depending on their dependency status

## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive, step-by-step approach to complete the HIVE platform for its initial launch. The plan is now organized around the router architecture and navigation paths, focusing on delivering complete user flows through specific routes.

## Conclusion

This router-based completion plan focuses on delivering fully functional user journeys through specific routes rather than abstract feature areas. By organizing work around the application's navigation structure, we ensure that each screen and flow is complete with all necessary UI components, business logic, data integration, and navigation behavior.

The plan now includes explicit dependencies between tasks and clear status indicators (âœ…, ðŸŸ¢, ðŸ”’) that make it easy to:
1. See what has been completed (âœ…)
2. Identify what is ready to work on next (ðŸŸ¢)
3. Understand what is blocked and why (ðŸ”’)
4. Track the dependency relationships between tasks

As tasks are completed, their status should be updated from ðŸŸ¢ to âœ…, and dependencies should be reviewed to update tasks from ðŸ”’ to ðŸŸ¢ as appropriate.

Progress should be tracked by checking off items in this plan as they are completed, with regular reviews to assess the overall status of the project and adjust priorities based on critical user flows.
